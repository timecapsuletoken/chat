# **TimeCapsule Chat ðŸ“œðŸ’¬** React Decentralized Application (dApp)

## Overview

This project is a fully decentralized application (dApp) built with React, leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized data storage to enable real-time messaging, wallet-based authentication, and secure communication. The application integrates cutting-edge tools like **Gun.js** for decentralized storage, **ethers.js** for blockchain interaction, and React for a seamless and responsive user interface.

## Features

### Wallet Integration

- **MetaMask** and **Coinbase Wallet** support for secure user authentication.
- Automatic wallet detection and connection.
- Responsive wallet login for both mobile and desktop environments.

### Real-Time Messaging

- **Gun.js** powers a real-time, decentralized chat system.
- End-to-end encryption of messages using custom cryptographic utilities.
- Persistent chat storage for secure and reliable communication.

### Input Sanitization

- Protects against malicious inputs with comprehensive sanitization logic.
- Ensures a secure and safe user experience.

### Responsive Design

- Built with Material UI for consistent and adaptive UI components.
- Fully functional on mobile and desktop devices.
